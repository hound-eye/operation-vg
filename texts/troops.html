Our team is equipped with smuggled and trophy arms.
Rifles, machineguns, grenade launchers, as well as ammo and medical supplies. Infiltrators will have civilian contractor's cloths, concealable weapons a Jeep parked at the safehouse for use.<br/><br/>
Our contact promised us to bring ammo and medicine for ressuply at the meeting point, but other than that, we can only count on resupply from scavenging of enemy equipment.<br/><br/>

No fire support is available for us.<br/><br/>

Reinforcements for your team may become available while the operation is in progress, should you suffer losses. They may join the main force along the paths from Moddergat to Doodstil. Though these reinforcements routes, once compromised by the enemy, may become inaccessiable.<br/><br/>

We plan for a possible contingency, that there will be no transport at the docks ready for use by your team.
A couple of RHIB boats (Callsign "Hades") are going to be on standby at the safe distance, and could be called in for extraction.<br/><br/>
