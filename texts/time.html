We aim to start the operation at around 1600 hours. We will have a limited amount of time, before the initial garrison of Moddergat Gendarmerie is reinforced by HIDF. Time is of the essence in this mission, as the enemy will immediately respond to our attack by locking down areas and cutting the reinforcements routes.<br/><br/>
