This island has a moderate presense of goverment militarized police (Gendarmerie) and Horizon Islands Defence Force (HIDF).</br>

  Gendarmerie is the primary peace force on the island of Moddergat, where they holdand guard several key buildings, one of which we suspect to be the place for intelligence operations.
  Gendarmerie is armed primarily with pistol caliber carbines and pistols, wear body armor, and use civilian trucks and vans for transport.

HIDF is mainly armed with battle rifles and machineguns, use lightly armored trucks and HMMWVs. The coast guard base has some static defenses on its perimeter, and RHIB boats are known to be as their main way of water transport.
HIDF airforce primarily uses UH-1 transport helicopters, occasionally outfitted with doorgunners. They may be used as a quick reaction force transport.

There are also unknown criminal and mercenary groups, status and intentions of which are now well known to us.
