The terrain on island Moddergat, like many other islands of Tanoa has a lot of thick jungle and hills.<br/><br/>
There are several hills overlooking Moddergat, and several pathways that we can use to assemble our troops around the Moddergat.<br/><br/>

We best avoid the cities of Haicourt and Lijnhaven, as they have substantial HIDF garrisons, as that control the primary means for the population to enter the island - the airport and bridge. Military will be promptly mobilized to lockdown these areas, once they become aware of the attack.<br/><br/>

The meeting place with contact is chosen at the remote spot, where after exchange, he is expected to lay low in the jungle afterward, until all of this blows over.<br/><br/>

We are expecting high precipitation on the day of the operation.<br/><br/>
